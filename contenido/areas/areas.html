                        Daggers are a Weapon Category in Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered. Daggers have
                        short reach and
                        deliver
                        fast and precise attacks, enabling players to dodge and land successive strikes to stagger the
                        enemy
                        even in
                        close quarters. These weapons have two basic Damage Types: Thrust and Slash. They generally have
                        good
                        Dexterity Scaling and high critical damage. Daggers can also be wielded as left-handed weapons
                        and
                        used
                        to
                        Parry. Daggers are a great option for those wanting to apply Crystal Magic Weapon and Rotten
                        Pine
                        Resin.

                        Pros: Lightweight, Fast, can Parry, good Dex scaling and Critical. Useful in narrow spaces.
                        Cons: Low per-hit Damage, very short Range, limited selection of Weapons.</div>

                    <div class="text">Straight Swords are a Weapon Category in Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered.
                        Straight Swords have increased damage and reach, but are relatively slow when compared to
                        Daggers.
                        Although the swing speed is slower, the additional range makes up for it, and Straight Swords
                        are a
                        great choice for attacking multiple opponents with one fast swing motion. Higher base Physical
                        damage balances out lesser Dexterity scaling and Critical Damage. Straight Swords are an ideal
                        weapon for players willing to strike a balance between Attack Rating and Speed in their builds.

                        Pros: Well-rounded weapon profile, light, with good range, decent damage and low Stamina
                        consumption. Useful for attacking multiple opponents with horizontal slashes.
                        Cons: Mediocre overall scaling and low Dexterity scaling which affects Critical Damage Hit.

                        Greatswords
                        are powerful blades with a wide swing radius and long reaching attacks, enabling the wielder to
                        target multiple opponents within the radius of the swing motion. As a balancing factor, these
                        weapons are considerably heavier, resulting in slower attacks and requiring more stats and more
                        effort to swing. Given the strength and range of these sweeping attacks, Greatswords can stagger
                        enemies long enough to land another strike/hit.

                        Pros: High Attack Power, wide swing radius, decent scaling, tolerable stat requirements, potent
                        when
                        two-handed.
                        Cons: Bad critical hit chance, heavy, slow, and tricky to use in small spaces such as corridors
                        due
                        to the weapon's size. </div>

                        Ultra
                        Greatswords are heavy weapons and require a considerable strength investment to wield. Their
                        swings
                        are slow but far-reaching, wide and extremely powerful, capable of stunning enemies caught in

                        hit. Ultra Greatsword users can therefore perform several stun-lock combos, missing an attack
                        however leaves the wielder wide open for enemy retaliation. This weapon class has the highest
                        physical damage reduction and stability when used for blocking incoming hits.</div>

                        Curved
                        Swords are fast, medium range weapons similar to Straight Swords but are focused on Dexterity
                        Scaling, and feature a fluid moveset. Most of these weapon have 2 basic damage types: Slash and
                        Thrust. They are suitable for narrow spaces as enemies will have trouble moving around to dodge
                        or
                        block the fast moving attacks. All Curved Swords kick move is replaced with an evasive slash
                        attack
                        that causes the wielder to flip away after a swift strike. Thanks to their attack speed, Curved
                        Swords are a great option for players wanting to apply weapon buffs like Darkmoon Blade or
                        Rotten
                        Pine Resin.

                        Pros: Lightweight, high attack speed and low Stamina consumption, good Dexterity scaling. Useful

                        narrow spaces.
                        Cons: Ineffective against heavy armor and shields, lesser reach than Short Swords.</div>

                        can

                        with a wide medium-range arc attack motion. They provide hard hitting attacks that deal very
                        high
                        damage at the expense of swing speed. Larger axes require players to consider each attack

                        player open to enemy counters when a hit does not connect. Most of these weapon have 2 basic

                        Pros: Good Strength Scaling. Moderate weight vs other heavy weapons. Quick follow up attack
                        animation if the first strike connects. Extremely efficient in breaking Poise, can stunlock
                        targets,

                        combat.
                        The weapons are extremely fast and consume little stamina, allowing for long combos that can
                        break
                        enemies' guard or deplete their stamina. This strategy is useful in PvE but not in PvP as other
                        players will be able to parry the predictable fast repeating combo. These weapons can be wielded
                        in
                        the left hand or the right hand, each with different effects. Left-handing them grants the

                        Pros: Very lightweight, deals fast rapid combo damage consuming little stamina, undeflectable

                        Recommendations: Have plenty of stamina and low equip load to improve your recovery. Good to

                        movesets provide shield and two-hand variety.
                        Cons: Mediocre scaling for the lighter halberds, recovery time leaves users open to counter
                        attacks.
                        Recommendations: Use leo Ring to increase damage.</div>

                    <div class="text">Whips are a Weapon Category in Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered. Whips are
                        fast,
                        long range weapons that deal decent damage within a large radius. They are capable of stunning
                        targets for a long period of time which makes them good against Skeletons and other agile
                        opponents.
                        Whips can also be used left-handed in order to parry. Despite not being able to do combos, whips
                        are
                        fast enough that each separate swing comes quickly and chains together. These weapons are unique
                        as
                        they cannot be parried, but this comes with the downfall of the wielder not being able to do
                        backstab, riposte, or plunging attacks. A unique aspect of whips is that they don't show any
                        signs
                        of their augmentations until they are performing an attack. This is only useful for PvP.

                        Pros: Lightweight, fast, excellent attack arc, reliable damage, cannot be parried, good against
                        multiple enemies. Excellent Dexterity scaling.
                        Cons: Poor against any kind of armor, cannot perform backstabs, ripostes or plunging attacks.

                        long-ranged weapons that necessitate Arrows to function and possess no melee capability. There
                        are 2
                        types of bows; short bows and long bows, each with their own unique firing animations and
                        mechanics.
                        Short bows are well suited for PvP as they have a high firing rate (High Damage Per Second).
                        Long
                        bows are well suited for PvE, where they can snipe an opponents from long and safe distance.
                        Reloading is slower for longbows, making them less adequate for closer enemies such as PvP.
                        These
                        weapon scale well with Dexterity.

                        Pros: Short Bows; Fast firing rate, good scaling with dexterity and good for PVP. Long Bows;
                        Longer
                        Range than Short Bows, good scaling with dexterity and good for PvE.
                        Cons: Short Bows; Not as long range as Long bows. Long Bows; Takes time reloading arrow, lower
                        firing rate and deals less damage than Short bows.
                        Note: At high levels in Faith, Divine and Occult upgrade bows using Moonlight Arrows deal more
                        damage than the Darkmoon Bow.</div>

                        As some catalysts are meant to be used at lower levels (Oolacile, for example), they will reach
                        their optimal scaling level sooner than those meant to be higher level catalysts (Logan's).
